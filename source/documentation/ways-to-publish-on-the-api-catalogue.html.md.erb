# Ways to publish on the API catalogue

## Publishing APIs
The API catalogue uses the [OpenAPI 3 Specification](https://www.openapis.org/) (OAS) to document APIs. OAS  is recommended by the Open Standards Board and Government Digital Service.
 
Your OAS must include:

- the API title 
- a short API description up to 180 characters including spaces
- a publisher reference number used to identify your API
- a platform identifier given to you by us

For full details see : blah TODO

Check the GOV.UK Design System for [ways to document your API](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards#document-your-api) and [guidance on writing API reference documentation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/writing-api-reference-documentation). 
## Publishing file transfers

You can publish file transfers on the API catalogue.

You can bulk generate file transfer definitions from a CSV file using Excel or Google Sheets. 

Your file transfer definition must include:

- the title of your file transfer
- a short file transfer description up to 180 characters including spaces
- a publisher reference number used to identify your file transfer
- a platform identifier given to you by us
- List needs completing **TODO*


## Using the API catalogue publish API

Where should we host our OAS file? - TODO

 - API catalogue (when we have the swagger-ui renderer)
 - in the techdocs template (which doesn't work for our OAS?)
 - ???

## Using the API catalogue tools to publish content

The API catalogue publish tools let you:

- generate OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files
- generate file transfer definition files
- bulk publish OAS or file transfer definition files

See the [Gways to manage publishing on the API catalogue](https://github.com/hmrc/integration-catalogue-tools#readme)
