# Platforms, authorization and publisher reference

## Publisher reference

Each entry in the API catalogue needs a platform and a publisher reference to identify it. The combined platform
and publisher reference must be unique. If you have an identifier (such as API number) for your APIs or file transfers 
that does not change this will make a good publisher-reference.

## Platform

If you do not know your platform then contact the API catalogue to find out which platform you should use, or if a
new platform needs adding to the API catalogue. 

These are the codes that need passing in the API catalogue publish API
or using in the Open API specification or file transfer definitions.

| Name                                      | Code                |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| API Platform                              | API_PLATFORM        |
| Containerised Managed Architecture (CMA)  | CMA                 |
| Customs Declaration System (CDS Classic)  | CDS_CLASSIC         |
| Data Exchange Service (DES)               | DES                 |
| Integration Framework (IF)                | CORE_IF             |
| Transaction Engine                        | TRANSACTION_ENGINE  |

<%= warning_text('This may not be a complete list') %>
The a complete list of platform can be found in the [API catalogue publish API specification](<%=config[:tech_docs][:publish_api_link] %>)
in the `PlatformType` schema.

## Authorization

Each platform has a different authorization key used in the API catalogue publish API and integration-catalogue-tool when creating or updateing content.

You will need to contact the API catalogue team to get your authorization key if you do not know it.
