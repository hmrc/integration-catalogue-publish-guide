# What you need first

Before you can publish content on the API catalogue, you need to know:

 - your platform or if your platform needs adding to the API catalogue
 - your publish reference 
 - your platform authorization key given to you by us

 

## Your platform

Identify your platform using the platform code. You will need your platform code when using the API catalogue publish API, OpenAPI Specification (OAS) or file transfer definition.


| Name                                      | Code                |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| API Platform                              | API_PLATFORM        |
| Containerised Managed Architecture (CMA)  | CMA                 |
| Customs Declaration System (CDS Classic)  | CDS_CLASSIC         |
| Data Exchange Service (DES)               | DES                 |
| Integration Framework (IF)                | CORE_IF             |
| Transaction Engine                        | TRANSACTION_ENGINE  |

[See the complete list of platforms in the API catalogue publish API PlatformType schema](/api-catalogue/integrations/60d73648-c984-4733-8820-d23732ddd183/publish-api-for-the-api-catalogue).

Contact the API catalogue team at example@example.com If you do not know your platform or if your platform needs adding to the API catalogue.

## Your publisher reference 

Each API or file transfer in the API catalogue needs a publisher reference to identify it. 

The publisher reference can be numbers, characters or both, for example, 1234 or A#12Z.

If your API or file transfer already has a number that does not change, this will make a good publisher reference.

Publisher references cannot be changed once chosen. 

## Your platform authorization key

You need a platform authorization key to use the API catalogue publish API and API catalogue tools when publishing or updating content.

Contact the API catalogue team at example@example.com to get your authorization key if you do not know it.
