# What you need first

Before you can publish content on the API catalogue, you need:

 - your platform code 
 - [your publisher reference](/documentation/what-you-need-first.html#your-publisher-reference)
 - [your platform authorization key](/documentation/what-you-need-first.html#your-platform-authorization-key)

## Your platform code

Identify your platform using the platform code. You will need your platform code when [using the API catalogue publish API](<%=config[:tech_docs][:publishApiLink]%>),
[OpenAPI Specification (OAS)](/documentation/getting-in-right.html#if-you-have-oas-files) or [file transfer definition](/documentation/publishing-reference-guide.html#api-catalogue-file-transfer-definition).

[See the complete list of platforms in the API catalogue publish API PlatformType schema](<%=config[:tech_docs][:publishApiLink]%>).


Contact the API catalogue team at [api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk) if you do not know your platform or if your platform needs to be added to the API catalogue.

## Your publisher reference 

Each API or file transfer in the API catalogue has a publisher reference to identify it. 

The publisher reference can be numbers, characters or both, for example, 1234 or A#12Z.

If your API or file transfer already has a reference number that does not change, this will make a good publisher reference.

Publisher references cannot be changed once you have published content on the API catalogue. 

## Your platform authorization key

You need a platform authorization key to [use the API catalogue publish API](<%=config[:tech_docs][:publishApiLink]%>)
and [API catalogue tools](https://github.com/hmrc/integration-catalogue-tools#readme) when publishing or updating content.

Contact the API catalogue team at [api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk) to get your authorization key if you do not have one.

Once you have your platform code, publisher reference and platform authorization key, you can
[start publishing APIs](<%=config[:tech_docs][:publishApiLink]%>)
and [file transfers](/documentation/publishing-file-transfers.html).
