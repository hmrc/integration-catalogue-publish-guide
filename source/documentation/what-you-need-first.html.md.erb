<%# TODO : Use Mailto for email / link? %>
Contact the API catalogue team at api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk if you do not know your platform or if your platform needs to be added to the API catalogue.

## Your publisher reference 

Each API or file transfer in the API catalogue has a publisher reference to identify it. 

The publisher reference can be numbers, characters or both, for example, 1234 or A#12Z.

If your API or file transfer already has a reference number that does not change, this will make a good publisher reference.

Publisher references cannot be changed once you have published content on the API catalogue. 

## Your platform authorization key

<%# TODO : Sort links %>
You need a platform authorization key to [use the API catalogue publish API] LINK TO API IN CATALOGUE and [API catalogue tools] LINK TO API CATALOGUE TOOLS when publishing or updating content.

Contact the API catalogue team at api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk to get your authorization key if you do not have one.

<%# TODO : Sort links %>
Once you have your platform code, publisher reference and platform authorization key, you can [start publishing APIs] LINK TO PUBLISHING APIS and [file transfers] LINK TO PUBLISHING FILE TRANSFERS.
