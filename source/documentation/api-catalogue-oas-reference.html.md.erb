# API catalogue OpenAPI Specification Reference

The API catalogue currently supports Open API Specification version 3.

## Api Catalogue OAS Extensions

In order to ensure api catalogue functionality several [OAS Extensions](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions)
have been created to support data required by the catalogue.

Here is an example of the OAS specification with example extensions

```
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Test Api
  description: This is a test Api.
  version: "1.0"
  contact:
    name: First Surname
    email: first@surname@example.com
  x-integration-catalogue:
    platform: API_PLATFORM
    publisher-reference: address-lookup
    short-description: This is a private API.
    backends:
      - ETMP
paths:
  /customers/details/:
    get:
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
```
The fields need to be placed under an extension named **x-integration-catalogue**.

The available fields are :-

| FieldName            | Required |
| -------------------- |:-------------:|
| platform             |no |
| publisher-reference  |no |
| short-description    |no |
| backends             |no |

### Platform (platform)
Before you begin publishing to the API Catalogue you will be given a platform identifier.
For example API_PLATFORM.
The platform is used to identify where the API is hosted.
This value along with the publisher reference makes up the unique identifier for the API on the API Catalogue.

### Publisher Reference (publisher-reference)
The Publisher reference is an alpha numeric text field.
This value along with the platform makes up the unique identifier for the API on the API Catalogue.

### Short Description (short-description)
All APIs must have a short description of up to 180 characters including spaces.
It will appear on the search / list of the API Catalogue under the title of the API.

### Backends (backends)
This a list of alpha numeric text fields.
Each backend can be a system at HMRC exposed by endpoints in the API.
A backend can be a HoD (Head of Duty) system.
Examples of backends are ETMP and NPS.

## Validation
During publishing the following fields are validated.description

* platform - This needs to be a valid platform. This is case insensitive.
* short-description - This needs to be up to 180 characters including spaces.

##Â Does the API catalogue support Swagger?

There is sometimes confusion between the difference between Swagger and Open API Specification. The Open API
Specification was based on the Swagger 2.0 when it was adoped as an open standard in 2015. Open API Specification
has moved on since and is now on version 3. 

Note: Sometimes people use the term Swagger to mean Open API Specification version 3, even though this is technically incorrect.

There is further information in the Open API Initiative's [FAQ](https://www.openapis.org/faq).
