# Publishing APIs

The API catalogue [uses the OpenAPI 3 Specification (OAS) to document APIs](https://www.openapis.org/). OAS  is recommended by the Open Standards Board and Government Digital Service.
 
Your OAS must include:

- [the API title](/documentation/getting-in-right.html#writing-good-titles-and-descriptions)
- [a short API description up to 180 characters including spaces](/documentation/getting-in-right.html#writing-good-titles-and-descriptions)
- [a publisher reference number used to identify your API](/documentation/what-you-need-first.html#your-publisher-reference)
- [an authorization key given to you by us](/documentation/what-you-need-first.html#your-platform-authorization-key)

[For full details see the API catalogue OAS reference guide](/documentation/publishing-reference-guide.html#api-catalogue-oas-extensions)

Check GOV.UK for [ways to document your API](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards#document-your-api) and [guidance on writing API reference documentation](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/writing-api-reference-documentation).
