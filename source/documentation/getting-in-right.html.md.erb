# Getting it right

Decide if you want to publish an API or file transfer. 

If you're publishing APIs,[see the reference guide for OpenAPI Specification (OAS) requirements](/documentation/publishing-reference-guide.html).

If you're publishing file transfers, [check the file transfer definition in the reference guide](/documentation/publishing-reference-guide.html#api-catalogue-file-transfer-definition).

## If you have OAS files

We recommend you take these steps. 

- [Use the API catalogue API to publish one API or file transfer first](https://admin.tax.service.gov.uk/api-catalogue/integrations/60d73648-c984-4733-8820-d23732ddd183/publish-api-for-the-api-catalogue)
- Bulk publish your APIs and file transfers [using the API catalogue tools](https://github.com/hmrc/integration-catalogue-tools#readme).
- See if there’s a way to automate publishing and updating APIs and file transfers.

## If you don’t have OAS files

You can use the API catalogue tools to create OAS files for APIs and file transfers using a CSV file.

[See the recommended CSV format](https://github.com/hmrc/integration-catalogue-tools#format-of-the-csv)</a>.

## Publishing quality content 

You cannot publish personal identification information (PII), offensive or inappropriate content. You are responsible for content about your API or file transfer. 

[See examples of good APIs and file transfers in the API catalogue.](/documentation/publishing-reference-guide.html#example-oas-specifications)

## Writing good titles and descriptions 

All APIs and file transfers need a title and short description of up to 180 characters. 

Tiles and descriptions appear on the search results page and the summary page for each API and file transfer. 

Titles and descriptions must be easy to read so people can scan them and find what they're looking for. 

Do not include 'API' in the title, only the name of the API. For example, Marriage Allowance.

Descriptions help users to know what they're looking at. 

All APIs and file transfers must have a short description of up to 180 characters, including spaces.

Avoid using the name of the API in the description. Do not start the sentence with 'This API'.

For example, here is the short description for the Marriage Allowance API. 

> Retrieve an individual's marriage allowance status or check their partner's eligibility to be a marriage allowance recipient.

## Handling platform connectivity issues

If you use the stride network or the corporate VPN you can access the API catalogue and the API catalogue publish API. 

Check you have access to the API catalogue by browsing or CURLing the URL:

```
curl 'https://admin.tax.service.gov.uk/integration-catalogue-admin-api/services/integrations?platformFilter=API_PLATFORM&searchTerm=%22Check%20a%20UK%20EORI%20Number%22'
```

Contact the API catalogue team on [api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk) if you cannot access the URL.
