# Getting it right

Decide if you want to publish an API or file transfer.

See the requirements for OAS and file transfer definitions.

- [API catalogue OpenAPI specification]("/documentation/api-catalogue-oas-reference.html#api-catalogue-openapi-specification-reference")
- [API catalogue file transfer specification]("/documentation/api-catalogue-file-transfer-reference.html#api-catalogue-file-transfers-reference")

## If you have OAS files

We recommend you take these steps 

Use the API catalogue API to publish one API or file transfer first. 
Bulk publish your APIs and file transfers using the API catalogue tools.
See if there’s a way to automate publishing and updating APIs and file transfers.

## If you don’t have OAS files

You can create bulk generated OAS files for APIs and file transfers using a CSV file.

See the recommended [CSV format]("https://github.com/hmrc/integration-catalogue-tools#format-of-the-csv")</a>.

You cannot publish personal identification information (PII), offensive or inappropriate content. You are responsible for content about your API or file transfer.
