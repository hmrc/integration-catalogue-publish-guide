# Publishing file transfers

You can publish file transfers on the API catalogue.

You can bulk generate file transfer definitions from a CSV file using Excel or Google Sheets. 

Your file transfer definition must include:

- [the title of your file transfer](/documentation/getting-in-right.html#writing-good-titles-and-descriptions)
- [a short file transfer description up to 180 characters including spaces](/documentation/getting-in-right.html#writing-good-titles-and-descriptions)
- [a publisher reference number used to identify your file transfer](/documentation/what-you-need-first.html#your-publisher-reference)
- [an authorisation key given to you by us](/documentation/what-you-need-first.html#your-platform-authorization-key)

[See the API catalogue file transfer definition](/documentation/publishing-reference-guide.html#api-catalogue-file-transfer-definition) for full details
