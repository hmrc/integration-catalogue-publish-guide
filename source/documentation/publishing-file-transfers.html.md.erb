# Publishing file transfers

You can publish file transfers on the API catalogue.

You can bulk generate file transfer definitions from a CSV file using Excel or Google Sheets. 

Your file transfer definition must include:

- [a short file transfer description up to 180 characters including spaces] LINK TO WRITING GOOD API TITLES AND DESCRIPTIONS
- [a publisher reference number used to identify your file transfer] LINK TO PUBLISHER REFERENCE IN WHAT YOU NEED FIRST
- [an authorisation key given to you by us] LINK TO AUTHORIZATION KEY IN WHAT YOU NEED FIRST
