# Publishing file transfers

You can publish file transfers on the API catalogue.

You can bulk generate file transfer definitions from a CSV file using Excel or Google Sheets. 

Your file transfer definition must include:

- the title of your file transfer
- a short file transfer description up to 180 characters including spaces
- a publisher reference number used to identify your file transfer
- an authorisation key given to you by us

[See the API catalogue file transfer reference](/documentation/api-catalogue-file-transfer-reference.html#schema) for full details.
