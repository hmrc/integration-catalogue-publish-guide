# Publishing reference guide

The API catalogue currently supports Open API Specification version 3.

## API catalogue OAS extensions

Several [OAS extensions have been created to support the data required in the API Catalogue](https://swagger.io/specification/#specification-extensions).

Here is an example of the OAS specification with example extensions.

```
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Test API
  description: This is a test API.
  version: "1.0"
  contact:
    name: First Surname
    email: first@surname@example.com
  x-integration-catalogue:
    reviewed-date: 2021-04-01T19:19:08.000Z
    platform: API_PLATFORM
    publisher-reference: address-lookup
    short-description: This is a private API.
    status: LIVE
    backends:
      - ETMP
paths:
  /customers/details/:
    get:
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
```
Fields must be placed under an extension named **x-integration-catalogue**.

Here are the available fields.

| FieldName            | Required |
| -------------------- |:-------------:|
| reviewed-date        |yes |
| platform             |no |
| publisher-reference  |no |
| short-description    |no |
| status               |no |
| backends             |no |

### Reviewed date

The reviewed date is when you last checked the API. 

The reviewed date is mandatory and formatted as an [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/standard/40874.html) DateTime field. 

For example, date formats ```2018-12-13T19:19:08.000Z``` and ```2018-12-13``` are both valid.

### Platform
Before you begin publishing to the API Catalogue you will be given a platform identifier, for example, API_PLATFORM. The platform is used to identify where the API is hosted. 

Contact the API catalogue team at [api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk](mailto:api-catalogue-g@digital.hmrc.gov.uk) if you donâ€™t know your platform or if your platform needs adding to the catalogue.

### Publisher Reference 
Each API needs a publisher reference to identify it. The publisher reference can be numbers, characters or both, for example, 1234 or A#12Z.

If your API already has a reference number that does not change, this will make a good publisher reference.

### Short descriptions

All APIs must have a [short description of up to 180 characters including spaces](/documentation/getting-in-right.html#writing-good-titles-and-descriptions). Short descriptions appear under the API title on the search results page on the API catalogue.

### Status

Tell us the status of the API. Valid status values are:

| Status Code       | What is shown in the API catalogue                                                |
| ------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ALPHA             | Alpha - not ready to use (documentation only and could change)                    |
| BETA              | Beta - early stage of development and may be available (expect breaking changes)  |
| LIVE              | Live - available to use                                                           |
| DEPRECATED        | Deprecated - not recommended for use                                              |

If the status field is missing the status will default to LIVE when published.

### Backends 
Backends are a system at HMRC exposed by endpoints in the API. A backend can be a Head of Duty system, for example, ETMP or NPS.

## Validation

During publishing we validate:

- if the platform is valid 
- the short description is up to 180 characters including spaces
- if the staus is valid 

## API catalogue file transfer definition

A file transfer is defined in the following JSON schema.
